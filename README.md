## 📖 About the Book

*Probabilistic Robotics* is a comprehensive guide to the concepts and methodologies underpinning probabilistic techniques in robotics. This approach allows robots to effectively manage uncertainty in perception, motion, and control. From localization to mapping and advanced path planning, this book provides a detailed exploration of modern robotics concepts.

In this repository, you’ll find:

- 📚 **Chapter-wise Solutions**: Complete solutions to all exercises in the book.
- 🧩 **Example Code**: Python/MATLAB implementations for key algorithms like Kalman filters, particle filters, and SLAM.
- 📊 **Simulation Data**: Test datasets to run and analyze algorithms in action.

By following this repository, you can deepen your understanding of probabilistic robotics, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application.
